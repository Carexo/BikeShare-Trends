# San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository is a project made as an assignment in the Probability and Statistics course 2024/25 at AGH University of Krakow.

This project analyse the [**San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share) dataset and allows you to explore patterns and trends in bike-sharing usage. The dataset provides detailed information about bike trips, including start and end locations, trip durations.

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis, including:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Loading the dataset into a SQLite database and addressing missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Generating descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots), and identifying key trends in bike-sharing usage.
3. **Statistical Modeling:** Developing simple statistical models to analyze dependencies between variables and potentially predict user behavior.
